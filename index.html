        <p> I love Sports, Why you ask? Well it's because when i was 6 years old I saw some people playing Soccer and I got intrested and started playing soccer too then I started going to soccer classes and I loved it, It was amazing after that i got introduced to other types of sports like badminten,swimming,basketball,tennis and much more It was like I was in a world of sports and nothing could stop me from playing it and even now I still play sports and go to different types of sports classes.And evrytime I am playing sports I feel this excitment in my hands and feet I feel the urge to run and scream to the whole world "I LOVE SPORTS!!!!" what is your hobby? </p>

            I love sports, you guys already know that and you guys alo kno wthat I like all the sports I mean I like most sports but it does not mean I can't rank them so I went on ahed and ranked my most favorite sports and number 1 is soccor why you say so? Well I have been playing soccor ever since I was 6 and I found it intresting and I dont know why I found it more intresting than swimming because the first sport I have ever done is swimming and I loved but I had this feeling that soccor is a little bit more intresting than swimming not saying that I don't like swimming but I find soccor a bit moreintresting.
